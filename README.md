1. `rama_spectra_files/figure-markdown_github`: Directory with the figures.  
1. `Data-Raman_Raul.xlsx`: Dataset  
1. `README.md`: This is a markdown document.   
1. `rama_spectra.Rmd`: This is a R-markdown document that generates the markdown document for github documentation.  
1. **`rama_spectra.r`: THIS IS THE R-CODE.**  

Step 1: Data reading and ordering
=================================

The first steps only uploads the `xlsx` file and concatenates each sheet into one woorkbook.

    ## [1] "READING sheet 1 ..."
    ## [1] "READING sheet 2 ..."
    ## [1] "READING sheet 3 ..."
    ## [1] "READING sheet 4 ..."
    ## [1] "READING sheet 5 ..."
    ## [1] "READING sheet 6 ..."
    ## [1] "READING sheet 7 ..."
    ## [1] "READING sheet 8 ..."
    ## [1] "READING sheet 9 ..."
    ## [1] "READING sheet 10 ..."

Step 2: Baseline Correction
===========================

Baseline is corrected with a 2nd derivative constrained weighted regression. It was the optimal method provided from the package `baseline` from R.
The next two graphs show the raw data of Control.1-area.1 on the left with the baseline fitted (red line) and the baseline fitted on the right.

Step 3: Signal to Noise Ratio
=============================

The SNR was caculated here in case is needed for further analysis, as a cofounding variable, as a set up for smothing or just as quality control check point. Blue are control cases, red experimental.

Step 4: Smoothing of the signal
===============================

Two options here the Nadayara-Watson Kernel or a fast furier transformation with convolution.
The smoothing of the signal is made in order to improve the SNR.

Step 5: Normalization of the data and Peak detection
==================================================

This is done in two steps first we normalized all data to the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) and then we search those peaks that are above 2 standart deviation of the MAD. ![](rama_spectra_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)

Step 6: Data Visualization
==========================

### Heatmap of all cases

### Detection of duplicated data and Heatmap of Non-duplicated data

#### Control vs Experiment spectra
